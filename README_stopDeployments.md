To stop a Kubernetes deployment (and all its resources), follow these steps:

### **1. Stop the Deployment**
```bash
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=0
```
Example:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment app-deployment --replicas=0
```

### **2. Verify Pods Are Terminated**
```bash
kubectl get pods
```
Should show no running pods for that deployment.

---

### **Alternative Methods**
#### **A. Delete the Entire Deployment**
```bash
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>
```
Example:
```bash
kubectl delete deployment app-deployment
```

#### **B. Stop All Resources in a Namespace**
```bash
kubectl delete all --all -n <namespace>
```

#### **C. Stop Specific Resources**
```bash
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml  # Uses the manifest file
```

---

### **Key Notes**
1. **Scaling to 0**:
   - Preserves the deployment configuration for later restart.
   - Run `kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=1` to restart.

2. **Deleting**:
   - Removes the deployment permanently (recreate with `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` later).

3. **Cascading Effects**:
   - Stopping a deployment also terminates its pods.
   - Services will show "No endpoints" until pods restart.

---

### **Restarting Later**
```bash
kubectl scale deployment <name> --replicas=1
# OR
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
